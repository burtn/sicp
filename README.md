I have [read](http://www.learningclojure.com/2011/02/advice-to-newbie.html) that a good way to learn [LISP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_%28programming_language%29) is to work through [SICP](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/) (I used the [Kindle version](https://github.com/twcamper/sicp-kindle)). 

These are my solutions to the exercises in the book.

Notes:
- I'm using [DrRacket](http://racket-lang.org/download/) on a Mac with the language set to [R5RS](http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/).
- **non-standard indentation ahead**, some of my early solutions may contain _different_ indentation whilst I get my head around the ()'s
